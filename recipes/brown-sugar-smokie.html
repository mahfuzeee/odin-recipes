    <!-- Description -->
    <p>These bacon-wrapped little smokies with a brown sugar glaze are sweet, smoky, 
        and super easy to make for parties or holiday appetizer. 
        You can make these little smokies on skewers or toothpicks to secure the bacon.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Home cooks agree that baking on a rack stops burning sugar and keeps bacon crispier.

    <!-- Ingredients -->
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <p>Amount for 12 Servings</p>
     <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package little smokie sausages</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar, or to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Cut bacon slices into thirds and wrap each strip around a sausage. Secure the wrapped sausages on wooden skewers, several to a skewer. Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and sprinkle them liberally with brown sugar. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and sugar has melted into a glaze, 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway through for even caramelization.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving platter and let stand 5 minutes before serving; the glaze will thicken as it cools. Serve and enjoy! </li>
     </ol>
